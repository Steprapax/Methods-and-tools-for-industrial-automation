# Methods-and-tools-for-industrial-automation
This repo contains three projects/exercices

In project 1:
  The word document describe the exercise, there are a simulink model and the project developed in matlab to resolve and describe it;
  in the folder "First part" there are basic LQG, LQT, LQR and Kalman functions developed in matlab.

project 2:
  The exercise is a scheduling problem it's developed in matlab using an heuristic solution, 
  lingo it's used to find the optimal solution;
  in the folder "Second part" there are the moore's and jhonson's algorithms developed using matlab and lingo.
  
project 3:
  The first exercise is a "Route first cluster second" problem solved in lingo;
  the second is a big excel file that contain an evaluation of the daily sales over a year for 5 petrol sales points 
  using basic statistical indices such as averages, standard deviations, correlations between points of sale and 
  linear trend of sales. There are also the tests of the effectiveness of 5 methods of forecasting the future sales demand of all 5 sales
  points using 4 different criteria(exponential average, regression, moving average 7 days, moving average 4 weeks).
